### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
Pronouns: regular 'he/him' at your service

Currently a second year Computer Engineering Student, focusing more so in the software branch.

I'm currently working on just learning anything I can honestly. Making sense of all these technologies is really daunting.

Aside from being busy with learning Engineering maths and Data Structures at Uni this year, I'm currently learning Django and Python in general. I knew HTML and CSS and have worked at some level with PHP and SQL and this I believe is the next step.
My side interests are game engines like Godot, and creating games on them.
I have started reading up on OpenGL as a *really* side curiosity of mine.(I don't expect to learn to do anything meaningful with that for a while, but learning how it works from a distance is nice)

As you can probably tell I haven't made up my mind on what specialty I'm going to go for. I'm taste testing all things I can and have viable amount of time to learn and try.

I hope to be able to make sense of how to read codebases on github and hopefully contribute something on here.

I have a linkedin: www.linkedin.com/in/amirhossein-basirat-355191287

That's it for now, I'll update this README as time goes by.
